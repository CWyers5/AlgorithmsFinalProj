*The FlightFinder program requires c++11 to correctly compile
*To compile the program from the command line, use -std=c++11 when compiling
After compiling the program, you can run the program by calling graph.exe [flights file]

Here, the flights file starts with the number of cities in the list
Next, each city name is listed,
Finally, all the flight data is listed

The program then takes all this data, parses it into several adjacency matrixes and performs calculations

To run the program, enter the program name with the flights file as a parameter

Next, if you enter 0, a menu will appear displaying all the choices of things you can do within 
the program.

Simply enter the corresponding number of the action you wish to execute.

When prompted for a city, simply enter the city name. Each city will be printed for you to make
it easier to spell and remember your options.
When asked for distance,price, etc. Enter the value as a number with no alpha or special characters

*Note, remember to exit the program from the menu, do not hit the X in the top right corner.
*Failure to correctly exit the program will result in unsaved changes being discarded.
