*The FlightFinder program requires c++11 to correctly compile
*To compile the program from the command line, use -std=c++11 when compiling
After compiling the program, you can run the program by calling graph.exe [flights file]

Here, the flights file starts with the number of cities in the list
Next, each city name is listed,
Finally, all the flight data is listed
